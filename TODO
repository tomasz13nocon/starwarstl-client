TODO:parser - things to do/change when switching from wtf_wikipedia to a different parser

Comic issues should have something like a colored square as color coding of the series it belongs to (distinct from color coding of the media type)
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
only single table row can be expanded
linking to stuff like Author: "Various"
handle lists everywhere we're getting text() from infobox

PRODUCTION:
try fetching: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Board_game
and other stuff, and see if there's an error in the console
main.js is 12MB!! <- is this dev bundle problem?
reduce library size (code splitting??)

ATTRIBUTIONS:
fonts
covers
wookieepedia icon
spinner: https://loading.io/
