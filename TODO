persist expansion of rows

collapsable filters (this allows for many more filters)
  reddit-like vertical lines to collapse filters
  OR
  search "series: The Clone Wars" (with autocomplete, suggestions etc.)
multiple publishers filter (If I want to see DLF books, then show me those released by DLF _and_ others)
make columns like "cover" not sortable/clickable
handle italics (see TPM, "star wars" is in quotes but those are italics!!)
fix <br> handling? the clone wars film has unknown date
color coded comic/tv series with visual indication of how long it runs (aka swdatapad)
  Comic issues should have something like a colored square as color coding of the series it belongs to (distinct from color coding of the media type)
  button to switch to color coding seperate comic series
Different color tints based on subtype (target audience for books, animated/liveaction/web for tv, mobile/non-mobile for games, comic issues/comic stories for comics (can we do kid comics? IDW?))
see: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_High%20Republic%20Adventures%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Monster%20of%20Temple%20Peak%204
responsive/mobile version
dark theme
fetch timeline with basic info only to cut initial load time, then fetch the one with full details
for tv episodes' (and comis issues?) details show "out of" e.g.: Episode: 8 (out of 16)
include writer in details if it's in the timeline but not in article (like i did with release dates)
CTRL-F alternative (second search box in addition to the filtering one)
partial loading of large images?
customizable columns ("cover" column) (long term?)

LAST:
yt guides, how to's, tooltips

LONG TERM:
a "solo" button on the filters (or right click) to unckech everything else but this one
settings and filter presets to localStorage/account
user accounts for settings/filters
fix the ":wikipedia:Page" links (these get interpreted as internal links by wtf, they work in mw as interwiki, but it is an undocumented feature...) (example: Divide and Conquer)
collapse adjacent comic issues/tv episodes
clickable links to other entries in the timeline (mostly in "series" "followed by" "preceded by")
add padlock button to a filter to make it show regardless of search/filters (useful to always show movies)
  kinda related: for search add "," as an "OR" operator
save the "Exact placement unknown" symbol into DB as a bool flag and show it in timeline by changing Date's bg or sth
Add useMemo everywhere it fits
ability to save filter presets (and persist them to local storage/account) and switch between them
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
Image details when showing full size (credit to artist, copyright notice or link to it)
resize images to a certain max size (currently unlimited, some are many MBs)
accessiblity
link to web episodes (galaxy of adventures etc.)
a toggle to switch between bg covers and normal covers (in settings?)
fetch all book series, story collections, reference books, comic tpbs/omnibuses etc., comic arcs etc. How? Somehow.
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_reference_books
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_Young_Readers
- other stuff through pages in the timeline? e.g. series entry in comic issue infobox and tpbs in a table in series article etc.
- or just get the wiki dump, go through all pages and look for appropriate infoboxes
at the top of the page show random event from: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history
also show random event OOU that happend on current day from one of these pages: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/2001
also show stats about media (number of comic issues and books, for example)
Include Nav templates (like https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Template:ThrawnTrilogy)
Clicking on author's name shows all entries by this author
Searching appearances. Search "R2D2" click on "Character: RD2D" bullet that appears, and get all media that features R2
TOOLTIPS for:
-types (explain junior categorization etc.)
Upcoming episodes are sometimes (duplicate) links to the series itself. This causes fetch script to overwrite it. So.. handle mismatch of title and link.
legend type-indicators clickable to enable filtering for that type

PARSER:
"TODO:parser" - things to do when switching from wtf_wikipedia to a different parser
fetch this for list of supported interwiki prefixes:
https://starwars.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap

PRODUCTION:
when fetching details, only fetch fields we're using to save bandwidth
test diff browsers (including apple)
try fetching: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Board_game
and other stuff, and see if there's an error in the console
main.js is 12MB!! - is this dev bundle problem?
reduce library size (code splitting??)
test ul dot (it's a weird unicode char, some ppl might not have a font supporting it)
performance/profiing
