TODO:parser - things to do/change when switching from wtf_wikipedia to a different parser

Button to disable filtering without discarding filter setup
Comic issues should have something like a colored square as color coding of the series it belongs to (distinct from color coding of the media type)
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
only single table row can be expanded
linking to stuff like Author: "Various"
handle lists everywhere we're getting text() from infobox

PARSER:
fetch this for list of supported interwiki prefixes:
https://starwars.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap

PRODUCTION:
try fetching: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Board_game
and other stuff, and see if there's an error in the console
main.js is 12MB!! <- is this dev bundle problem?
reduce library size (code splitting??)

LONG TERM:
Include Nav templates (like https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Template:ThrawnTrilogy)
Clicking on author's name shows all entries by this author
Searching appearances. Search "R2D2" click on "Character: RD2D" bullet that appears, and get all media that features R2

ATTRIBUTIONS:
fonts
covers
wookieepedia icon
