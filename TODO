TODO:parser - things to do/change when switching from wtf_wikipedia to a different parser

multiple publishers filter (If I want to see DLF books, then show me those released by DLF *and* others)
make columns like "cover" not sortable/clickable
handle italics (see TPM, "star wars" is in quotes but those are italics!!)
fix <br> handling? the clone wars film has unknown date
image filenames need to be normalized from spaces to underscores, otherwise the filename hash is wrong
see: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_High%20Republic%20Adventures%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Monster%20of%20Temple%20Peak%204

button to switch to color coding seperate comic series
profile the filtering code (filter method gets called a lot when scrolling)
clickable links to other entries in the timeline (mostly in "series" "followed by" "preceded by")
try switching to display: table to make borders and vertical alignment work without workarounds. (and potentially widths too?)
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17915865/how-to-make-borders-collapse-on-a-div
reddit-like vertical lines to collapse filters
add padlock button to a filter to make it show regardless of search/filters (useful to always show movies)
save the "Exact placement unknown" symbol into DB as a bool flag and show it in timeline by changing Date's bg or sth
Add useMemo everywhere it fits
Button to disable filtering without discarding filter setup
Comic issues should have something like a colored square as color coding of the series it belongs to (distinct from color coding of the media type)
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
only single table row can be expanded
linking to stuff like Author: "Various"
handle lists everywhere we're getting text() from infobox

PARSER:
fetch this for list of supported interwiki prefixes:
https://starwars.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap

PRODUCTION:
try fetching: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Board_game
and other stuff, and see if there's an error in the console
main.js is 12MB!! <- is this dev bundle problem?
reduce library size (code splitting??)
test ul dot (it's a weird unicode char, some ppl might not have a font supporting it)

LONG TERM:
accessiblity
fetch all book series, story collections, reference books, comic tpbs/omnibuses etc., comic arcs etc. How? Somehow.
* https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_reference_books
* https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_Young_Readers
* other stuff through pages in the timeline? e.g. series entry in comic issue infobox and tpbs in a table in series article etc.
* or just get the wiki dump, go through all pages and look for appropriate infoboxes
at the top of the page show random event from: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history
also show random event OOU that happend on current day from one of these pages: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/2001
Include Nav templates (like https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Template:ThrawnTrilogy)
Clicking on author's name shows all entries by this author
Searching appearances. Search "R2D2" click on "Character: RD2D" bullet that appears, and get all media that features R2
