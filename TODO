TODO:parser - things to do/change when switching from wtf_wikipedia to a different parser

make multiple authors into a list or <br> at list
make columns like "cover" not sortable/clickable
treat 2022 as dec 31
mark unreleased media
make yr pink
short story brighter cyan

Add useMemo everywhere it fits
Button to disable filtering without discarding filter setup
Comic issues should have something like a colored square as color coding of the series it belongs to (distinct from color coding of the media type)
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
only single table row can be expanded
linking to stuff like Author: "Various"
handle lists everywhere we're getting text() from infobox

PARSER:
fetch this for list of supported interwiki prefixes:
https://starwars.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap

PRODUCTION:
try fetching: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Board_game
and other stuff, and see if there's an error in the console
main.js is 12MB!! <- is this dev bundle problem?
reduce library size (code splitting??)
test ul dot (it's a weird unicode char, some ppl might not have a font supporting it)

LONG TERM:
accessiblity
fetch all book series, story collections, reference books, comic tpbs/omnibuses etc., comic arcs etc. How? Somehow.
* https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_reference_books
* https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_Young_Readers
* other stuff through pages in the timeline? e.g. series entry in comic issue infobox and tpbs in a table in series article etc.
* or just get the wiki dump, go through all pages and look for appropriate infoboxes
at the top of the page show random event from: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history
also show random event OOU that happend on current day from one of these pages: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/2001
Include Nav templates (like https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Template:ThrawnTrilogy)
Clicking on author's name shows all entries by this author
Searching appearances. Search "R2D2" click on "Character: RD2D" bullet that appears, and get all media that features R2
