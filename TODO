search "series: The Clone Wars" (with autocomplete, suggestions etc.) or put series in the filters

  button to switch to color coding seperate comic series
see: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_High%20Republic%20Adventures%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Monster%20of%20Temple%20Peak%204
responsive/mobile version (mobile alternative to right click filters)
remove/change CHECK ALL/UNCHECK ALL?
dark theme (save preference to localStorage)
fetch timeline with basic info only to cut initial load time, then fetch the one with full details
for tv episodes' (and comis issues?) details show "out of" e.g.: Episode: 8 (out of 16)
CTRL-F alternative (second search box in addition to the filtering one)
partial loading of large images?
customizable columns ("cover" column) (long term?)

add logo to series in details
on accepting suggestions, remove text only up to last semicolon
do something about the series "Rebels" having a lot of dogshit
show count of books next to publisher filter, count of episodes in series etc.
Upcoming episodes are sometimes (duplicate) links to the series itself. This causes fetch script to overwrite it. So.. handle mismatch of title and link.
when changing filters (remember removing them too) scroll to the expanded entry (advertise this feature, low discoverability)
"scroll to start of page" button

LAST:
yt guides, how to's, tooltips
the state of the app while data is fetching.
clear this todo, TODOs in code, console logs, errors/warns when fetching

IDK:
include writer in details if it's in the timeline but not in article (like i did with release dates)
fix <br> handling? the clone wars film has unknown date

LONG TERM:
maybe: reddit-like vertical lines to collapse filters
pressing enter after search should expand the item
continuity of comics and crossover events (are they a series?)
readlist. Ability to mark stuff as watched/read (and a way to filter those out) and add stuff to watchlist/readlist
show a list of recently used (box) filters
"writer/penciller" in timeline for comics
make "Adaptaions" filter work
user accounts for settings/filters
fix the ":wikipedia:Page" links (these get interpreted as internal links by wtf, they work in mw as interwiki, but it is an undocumented feature...) (example: Divide and Conquer)
collapse adjacent comic issues/tv episodes
clickable links to other entries in the timeline (mostly in "series" "followed by" "preceded by")
add padlock button to a filter to make it show regardless of search/filters (useful e.g. to always show movies)
  kinda related: for search add "," as an "OR" operator
Add useMemo everywhere it fits
ability to save filter presets (and persist them to local storage/account) and switch between them
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
Image details when showing full size (credit to artist, copyright notice or link to it)
resize images to a certain max size (currently unlimited, some are many MBs)
check accessiblity
link to yt for web episodes (galaxy of adventures etc.)
a toggle to switch between bg covers and normal covers (in settings?)
fetch all book series, story collections, reference books, comic tpbs/omnibuses etc., comic arcs etc. How? Somehow.
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_reference_books
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_Young_Readers
- other stuff through pages in the timeline? e.g. series entry in comic issue infobox and tpbs in a table in series article etc.
- or just get the wiki dump, go through all pages and look for appropriate infoboxes
at the top of the page show random event from: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history

Clicking on author's name shows all entries by this author
Searching appearances. Search "R2D2" click on "Character: RD2D" bullet that appears, and get all media that features R2
TOOLTIPS for:
-types (explain junior categorization etc.)
legend type-indicators clickable to enable filtering for that type
when changing filters, and currently expanded entry is visible scroll to it after timeline changes
when fetching articles fetch only timestamps (not revisions aka wikitext), and only fetch revisions for those that ened updating to save bandwidth
FAQ TOC

FYI:
A trooper's worth's series field is a link + some text, but we get only link (shouldn't be a big issue for now)

"TODO:parser" - things to do when switching from wtf_wikipedia to a different parser

main.js is 12MB!! - is this dev bundle problem?
reduce library size (code splitting??)
test ul dot (it's a weird unicode char, some ppl might not have a font supporting it)
performance/profiing
