LAST:
test diff browsers (including apple)
test ul dot (it's a weird unicode char, some ppl might not have a font supporting it)
yt guides, how to's, tooltips

IDK:
for mobile change row click area to the entire row
"scroll to start of page" button
include writer in details if it's in the timeline but not in article (like i did with release dates)
fix <br> handling? the clone wars film has unknown date
see: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_High%20Republic%20Adventures%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Monster%20of%20Temple%20Peak%204
try fetching: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Board_game and other stuff, and see if there's an error in the console

LONG TERM:
reduce size of full size images?
preserve state across routes
skeleton crew has transparent cover, revealing blur
before pushing data to DB, backup old data in case of a breaking change. Keep a couple of backups.
CLEANUP: extract filters and timeline and timelineRow code into components (maybe also split timeline styles)
og meta tags
improve UX on filters
remove/change CHECK ALL/UNCHECK ALL?
instead of responsive display: none, don't render at all
performance/profiing
fetching:
- Upcoming episodes are sometimes (duplicate) links to the series itself. This causes fetch script to overwrite it. So.. handle mismatch of title and link.
- recover from "no infobox" maybe? -- Redlinks cause skip, but no infobox causes fetching error. Make them have the same effect (preferably recover and include in timeline with limited data).
Second layout for mobile (see designs)
cover thumbnails in mobile always on the left (use grid probably)
better visual seperation of sections in details, like wookiee
loading indication including for full size images (unclear due to bg img trick)
chekbox groups unexpand when changing browser width
color coded comic/tv series with visual indication of how long it runs (like swdatapad)
- Comic issues should have something like a colored square as color coding of the series it belongs to (distinct from color coding of the media type)
- button to switch to color coding seperate comic series
fetch cover artist from "File:" page
Add wookiee links to timeline notes?
Link to youtini page for given media?
amazon/audible referrals
Pull the entire wookieepedia to compile a list of media releases: ref books, art books, omnibuses, TPBs, lego/non-canon/non-story stuff, magazines, tabletop games. Only release date sorting. https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_media - This is close, but due to rare updates not viable as a source.
Other Books/entries in this Series (expandable list)
user made reading orders (interface for reordering and adding/removing entries. Interface for viewing these and upvoting commenting)
ignore list - add series/entries to ignore list and don't show them on the timeline (persisted with user acc/localStorage)
on accepting suggestions, remove text only up to last semicolon OR remove the semicolon feature OR write it properly (the last one)
fetch timeline with basic info only to cut initial load time, then fetch the one with full details (full one is 250 KB. Is this really necessary?)
dark theme (save preference to localStorage)
customizable columns ("cover" column)
maybe: reddit-like vertical lines to collapse filters
add logo to series in details
pressing enter after search should expand the item
continuity of comics and crossover events (are they a series?)
readlist. Ability to mark stuff as watched/read (and a way to filter those out) and add stuff to watchlist/readlist
show a list of recently used (box) filters
"writer/penciller" in timeline for comics
make "Adaptaions" filter work
user accounts for settings/filters
fix the ":wikipedia:Page" links (these get interpreted as internal links by wtf, they work in mw as interwiki, but it is an undocumented feature...) (example: Divide and Conquer)
collapse adjacent comic issues/tv episodes
clickable links to other entries in the timeline (mostly in "series" "followed by" "preceded by")
add padlock button to a filter to make it show regardless of search/filters (useful e.g. to always show movies)
  kinda related: for search add "," as an "OR" operator
Add useMemo everywhere it fits
ability to save filter presets (and persist them to local storage/account) and switch between them
Highlight more important entries in timeline row details (like Writer and Artist of the comic are more important than inker)
Image details when showing full size (credit to artist, copyright notice or link to it)
resize images to a certain max size (currently unlimited, some are many MBs)
check accessiblity
show count of books next to publisher filter, count of episodes in series etc.
for tv episodes' (and comis issues?) details show "out of" e.g.: Episode: 8 (out of 16)
link to yt for web episodes (galaxy of adventures etc.)
a toggle to switch between bg covers and normal covers (in settings?)
fetch all book series, story collections, reference books, comic tpbs/omnibuses etc., comic arcs etc. How? Somehow.
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_reference_books
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_Young_Readers
- other stuff through pages in the timeline? e.g. series entry in comic issue infobox and tpbs in a table in series article etc.
- or just get the wiki dump, go through all pages and look for appropriate infoboxes
at the top of the page show random event from: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history
also show random event OOU that happend on current day from one of these pages: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/2001
also show stats about media (number of comic issues and books, for example)
Include Nav templates (like https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Template:ThrawnTrilogy)
Clicking on author's name shows all entries by this author
Searching appearances. Search "R2D2" click on "Character: RD2D" bullet that appears, and get all media that features R2
TOOLTIPS for:
-types (explain junior categorization etc.)
legend type-indicators clickable to enable filtering for that type
when changing filters, and currently expanded entry is visible scroll to it after timeline changes
when fetching articles fetch only timestamps (not revisions aka wikitext), and only fetch revisions for those that ened updating to save bandwidth
FAQ TOC

FYI:
A trooper's worth's series field is a link + some text, but we get only link (shouldn't be a big issue for now)
