comic

-junior (can we even do this?)


TOGGLE: Distinct coloring for different series of comics/books (how to even do this with 1 table approach? Shades of one color aren't distinct enough... maybe disable this toggle unless only comics are selected in filters)
Clearly indicate when a search finds entries that are being filtered out (someone searches for something without realizing the filters they have on)
RANGES: limit timeline to specified range, make it easy to select "between movie a and b" or "empire era"
switch between comic issues, arcs, and series (same for tv shows, books)
also toggle between comic arc and trade paperback (in the same row, radio button)
TPB and omnibuses on different timeline
disable trade paperback checkobx when sorting by date, and add a tooltip explaining (?)
toggle sorting between release order and chronological
dynamic searching (show result as you type)
links to wookieepedia
show: release date, in-universe year, authors, artists/colorist(not by default), color coded type (adult book, junior comic, short story etc.), publisher
have a section for reference books
include stuff with questionable canon status and mark it as such
filters/sorting on the side, fixed position
save filtering and sorting (and presets) in localstorage
PRESET: a set of filtering settings
default preset: the most relevant non-junior media
default preset 2: movies and tv shows
allow users to create presets
option: collapse episodes: group episodes are chronologically in order (e.g. TCW s3e1 s3e3 s1e1-s1e15 s1e17-s1e21)
tv show seasons color coded (tints of one color?)
selecting an entry highlights related entries (same story arc, series etc.) (and maybe shows details on the side)

When something spans a lot of time, treat it as its beginning (further research)

Have a checkbox to ignore filters when searcing ("Search in all" or "Ignore filters")
Click entry to expand showing more information, including a "Included in:" section with all TBPs and collections that include this issue/arc


maybe/future:
mark stuff as viewed/read, and have option to hide those entries
